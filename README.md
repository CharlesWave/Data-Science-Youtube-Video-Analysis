# Data-Science-Youtube-Video-Analysis
This analysis collected 2000+ youtube videos randomly from 50 data-science youtube video channels using Youtube API.
The purpose of this analysis is to explore why some data-science youtube videos are more popular.

In this analysis, I discovered that number of views for data-science related videos could vary greatly. Although specific channels have more visibility than others, the difference in views could not be totally accounted by channel itself.

I then used wordcloud and chatgpt to analyze the titles of popular and unpopular videos, and found that popular videos have a larger share of data science upskilling content, whereas unpopular videos have a larger share of interview preparation content.

This finding is not surprising. With the concept of data science becoming well-known and large number of data scientists employed in various industries, videos focusing on introduction, basic technical skills or interview advice are not as helpful for the majority data science audience compared with upskilling tutorials. 

Therefore, for people who want to leverage their data science skills to create popular youtube videos, they'd more likely to succeed in creating tutorials that help lots of junior data practioners quickly progress in this ever-changing field.
